# ShouldYouRide

Should You Ride is a web application created using Node and ExpressJS. This is a independent project that is a way to expand my knowledge as a web developer, and to experience what it's like as a fullstack developer.
Understanding both the front-end and back-end parts of the development cycle is very important to me.

This is my first of many web applications. The idea for this web app came from one of my favorite hobbies - motorcycles. I ride any chance that I get to, and one of the things that I always had to check was the weather.
Checking the weather isn't difficult, however finding all of the information that you'd want before you go on a ride can be tedious. This website provides a centralized area to view all of those things, and more.

On ShouldYouRide, you'll find information on the following:
- Weather statistics in your area
- The next 12 hours of weather in your area
- Traffic conditions map in your area
- Wind speed and direction
- Chance of rain
- and many more features to come
